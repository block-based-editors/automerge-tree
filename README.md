# Automerge Blockly (tree)
(real-time) collaboration with block saved in a tree

For now no server is implemented and only a channel between two browsers is created:
Open two browser with the same url for example:
https://block-based-editors.github.io/automerge-tree/?my_context
https://block-based-editors.github.io/automerge-tree/?my_context

Now you will see that some basic events like creation, change value and move (including connect and disconnect) are mirrored not only locally but also to the other browser. You can experiment with Sync to remote (do I want to share my update directly) and Receive from remote (do I want to receive updates from other directly).
